###

<p align="left">This is a portfolio I coded for my Web Development class at the University of Northampton. It was developed over a 1 month period from February to March 2024, then assessed prior to starting the second assessment. Before starting this module, I already had 6 months experience on and off working on random website projects and front-end designs, which results in the final project you will see here.</p>

####

<h3 align="center">How did the project do on the assessment?</h3>

<p align="left">Results will be announced 4 weeks after the submission date, and so will be posted then.</p>
